## ✅ Commits Pushed to GitHub

**Repository:** https://github.com/Kimnjuki/faceless.git  
**Branch:** main

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Automatic Deployment (Vercel)
If Vercel is connected to your GitHub repository, deployment should trigger automatically.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Vercel detects push to `main` branch
- Automatically builds the project (`npm run build`)
- Deploys to production (contentanonymity.com)

**Check Deployment:**
1. Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Check the "faceless" project
3. Verify latest deployment status
4. Check deployment logs for any errors

### Manual Deployment (If Needed)

If automatic deployment doesn't work, you can deploy manually:

#### Option 1: Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### Option 2: GitHub Actions
If you have GitHub Actions set up, the push should trigger deployment.

#### Option 3: Manual Build & Deploy
```bash
npm run build
# Then upload dist/ folder to your hosting provider
```
