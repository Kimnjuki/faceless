Setting up your channel correctly sends positive signals to the YouTube algorithm before you even upload your first video.

## 1. Channel Identity
- **Name:** Choose a name that reflects the *niche*, not you. (e.g., ""History Bypass"" vs. ""John's History"").
- **Handle:** Ensure your @handle matches your channel name for SEO.
- **Banner:** Use a simple value proposition (e.g., ""New Dark History Documentaries Every Tuesday"").

## 2. Verification (Crucial)
You must verify your phone number to unlock:
- Custom Thumbnails (Required for CTR)
- Videos over 15 minutes
- Livestreaming

## 3. Upload Defaults (Time Saver)
Go to *Settings > Upload Defaults* and pre-fill:
- **Description:** Add your standard affiliate disclaimers and tool links (ElevenLabs, VidIQ).
- **Visibility:** Set to ""Unlisted"" so you can optimize 4K processing before publishing.
- **Tags:** Add your core niche keywords (e.g., ""True Crime"", ""Documentary"").

## 4. Branding Watermark
Upload a transparent PNG (150x150) of a ""Subscribe"" button to *Settings > Branding*. Set it to appear for the ""Entire Video"". This passive tactic increases sub count by ~5%.","A step-by-step checklist to setting up a high-CTR faceless channel, from verification to default upload settings.",,,beginner,15,0,true,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,,

If your first video gets 0 views, the algorithm thinks you are a bot. You need to ""warm"" the account.

## Phase 1: The Consumer Phase (Days 1-3)
**DO NOT UPLOAD YET.**
1. **Scroll:** Spend 15-20 minutes daily scrolling your specific niche (e.g., AI News).
2. **Engage:** Like, comment, and save videos *only* in your niche.
3. **Train:** If you see unrelated content (e.g., dancing trends), hold down and click ""Not Interested"".

## Phase 2: The First Upload (Day 4)
- **Device:** Upload from a phone, not a PC browser (better metadata trust).
- **Sound:** Use a ""Trending Sound"" but turn the volume to 1% if you have your own AI voiceover.
- **SEO:** Use 3-4 hashtags. #Niche #SpecificTopic #BroadTopic (e.g., #AI #ChatGPT #TechNews).

## Phase 3: The 200-View Jail
If you get stuck at 200 views for 10 videos straight:
- Change your **Hook** (visual or audio in the first 0.5 seconds).
- Shorten your video by 20%.
- Re-warm the account by engaging with top creators.","Stop getting stuck at 0 views. Learn how to ""warm up"" a new faceless TikTok account to train the algorithm.",,,intermediate,10,0,true,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,,

Views pay pennies. Sales pay dollars. Here is how to move faceless traffic off the platform.

## 1. The ""Bio"" Optimization
Your bio is not about you; it is about *them*.
- **Bad:** ""I post luxury cars.""
- **Good:** ""Helping you build online income 💸 | 👇 Free Blueprint Below""

## 2. The Caption Funnel
Instagram SEO is real.
- **Headline:** ALL CAPS HOOK related to the video.
- **Body:** 3-5 bullet points expanding on the value.
- **CTA:** ""Comment the word 'START' and I will DM you the link.""

## 3. Automation (ManyChat)
Manually DMing 100 people triggers spam filters. Use ManyChat to automate:
- User comments ""START"" -> Automation sends a DM with your landing page link.
- This boosts engagement (comments) AND clicks.

## 4. The ""Pinned"" Strategy
Create three ""Pillar"" posts and pin them to the top of your profile:
1. **Who you are** (The Brand Story).
2. **Social Proof** (Testimonials/Results).
3. **The Offer** (What you sell).","How to turn viral Reel views into email subscribers and high-ticket sales using the ""Pinned Comment"" strategy.",,,advanced,12,0,true,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,2025-11-25 12:21:29.369923+00,,
